# Calculating the value of information

 Implements a numerical version of the SDP described in (Sethi _et. al._ 2005).
 Compute the optimal solution under different forms of uncertainty.   




We consider a Beverton Holt state equation governing population dynamics, \\( f(x,h) = \frac{A x}{1 + B x} \\)



```r
f <- BevHolt
```





With parameters `A` = `1.5` and `B` = `0.05`.



```r
pars <- c(1.5, 0.05)
K <- (pars[1] - 1)/pars[2]
```




Note that the positive stationary root of the model is given by \\( \frac{A-1}{B} \\), or carring capacity `K` = `10`.  
We consider a profits from fishing to be a function of harvest `h` and stock size `x`,  \\( \Pi(x,h) = h - \left( c_0  + c_1 \frac{h}{x} \right) \frac{h}{x} \\), conditioned on \\( h > x \\) and \\(x > 0 \\),



```r
price <- 1
c0 <- 0.01
c1 <- 0
profit <- profit_harvest(price = price, c0 = c0, 
    c1 = c1)
```




with price `1`, `c0` `0.01` and `c1` `0`. 




```r
xmin <- 0
xmax <- 1.5 * K
grid_n <- 100
```




We seek a harvest policy which maximizes the discounted profit from the fishery using a stochastic dynamic programming approach over a discrete grid of stock sizes from `0` to `15` on a grid of `100` points, and over an identical discrete grid of possible harvest values.  




```r
x_grid <- seq(xmin, xmax, length = grid_n)
h_grid <- x_grid
```







```r
delta <- 0.05
xT <- 0
OptTime <- 25
```




We will determine the optimal solution over a `25` time step window with boundary condition for stock at `0` and discounting rate of `0.05`.  

# Scenarios: 

We use Monte Carlo integration over the noise processes to determine the transition matrix.

require(snowfall)
sfInit(parallel = TRUE, cpu = 16)
