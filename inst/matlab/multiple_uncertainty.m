%' SDP under multiple uncertainty
%'
%' Computes the SDP solution under the case of growth noise, 
%' implementation errors in harvesting, and meaurement errors in 
%' the stock assessment.  
%'
%' @param f the growth function of the escapement population (x-h)
%'   should be a function of f(y, h)
%' @param p the parameters of the growth function
%' @param x_grid the discrete values allowed for the population size, x
%' @param h_grid the discrete values of harvest levels to optimize over
%' @param sigma is the shape parameters for noise distribution (sigma_g, sigma_m, sigma_i) (default is no noise)
%' @return The D matrix giving the optimal harvest for each possible state in each timestep.  
%' Hence the optimal policy at time t is given by the policy function D(,t).  
%' Values of D(,t) correspond to the index of h_grid.  Indices of of D(,t) correspond to states in y_grid.
