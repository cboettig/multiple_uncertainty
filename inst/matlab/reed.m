function [D, V, P, f_matrix]  =  reed(f, x_grid, h_grid, Tmax, sigma_g, delta)
%' SDP under multiple uncertainty
%'
%' Computes the SDP solution under the case of growth noise, 
%' implementation errors in harvesting, and meaurement errors in 
%' the stock assessment.  
%'
%' @param f the growth function of the escapement population (x-h)
%'   should be a function of f(y, h)
%' @param p the parameters of the growth function
%' @param x_grid the discrete values allowed for the population size, x
%' @param h_grid the discrete values of harvest levels to optimize over
%' @param sigma_g is the shape parameters for noise distribution 
%' @return The D matrix giving the optimal harvest for each possible state in each timestep.  
%' Hence the optimal policy at time t is given by the policy function D(,t).  
%' Values of D(,t) correspond to the index of h_grid.  Indices of of D(,t) correspond to states in y_grid.

    %% Define a profit function.  
    %% For a trivial example, we assume no cost to harvesting, each fish sells for 1 unit.  
    %% So can sell as many fish as you harvested: 
    function out = profit(x,y)
      out = bsxfun(@min,x,y); 
    end  

    %% Compute the probability density on a discrete grid %%
    %%   (There must be a cleaner way to handle this.)
    function out = snap_to_grid(x, grid)
      [v,i] = min((grid - x).^2);
      out = grid(i);  
    end


    %% generate various sources of noise, or delta fns if noise is zero
    function out = pdfn(p, mu, s, grid)
      if mu == 0
        out = (p == 0);
      elseif s > 0
        if mu > 0
          out = unifpdf(p, mu .* (1 - s), mu .* (1 + s)); % Could use lognpdf for lognormal
        end
      else  % delta spike if s = 0
        out = isequal(histc(mu,grid), histc(p, grid));
